Got it! Let's make the README sound more friendly and approachable, while still providing all the important details. Here's a revised version:

# OTC Order Management Interface

Welcome to the OTC Order Management Interface! This is a simple, user-friendly app that lets you create, view, edit, and delete orders for various cryptocurrencies. The goal is to manage your crypto buy/sell orders with ease and get real-time USD conversions.

## What’s Inside?

Here’s what this app does:

- **Order Creation Form**: Easily create orders with options to buy or sell. Pick your cryptocurrency, enter the amount, and instantly see the USD equivalent.
- **Order Listing**: After you create an order, it shows up in a list below with all the key details like order direction (buy or sell), the selected crypto, how much, and when it expires.
- **Order Management**: You can edit or delete your orders anytime. If you change your mind or make a mistake, just click edit or delete – it’s that simple!
- **Real-Time Price Updates**: Prices are fetched in real-time using the CoinGecko API, so your USD conversion is always up-to-date.
- **Persistent Orders**: Even if you refresh the page, your orders are saved thanks to Zustand’s local storage persistence. No worries about losing your data!

### Tech Stack

Here’s what makes it all work:

- **React**: The backbone of the frontend.
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast build tool.
- **Zustand**: For keeping track of your orders and persisting them.
- **React Query**: Handles data fetching, especially those real-time price updates.
- **Material UI**: Clean, accessible components.
- **React Hook Form**: Makes handling forms a breeze.

## How to Run the Project

Alright, let’s get you up and running! Here’s how:

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/membrane-frontend-cc.git
cd membrane-frontend-cc
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to see the app running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Running Tests

If you want to run the tests, it's just as simple:

```bash
npm run test
```

Or if you’re like me and love watching your tests rerun as you code:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Environment Variables

Before you can get everything working, you’ll need to add an `.env` file to the root of the project. Here’s what you’ll need to include:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price
```

Make sure you have the correct API URL in there so the app can fetch real-time crypto prices.

## Challenges I Faced

Here’s where I get a bit real about what I went through while building this:

- **Real-Time Price Updates**: Making sure the USD equivalent updated smoothly while the user typed in the form took a bit of work. I used React Query to handle the API calls, and Zustand for state management, which made things smoother in the end.
- **Persisting Orders**: I had to make sure that even if you refresh the page, your orders are still there. Zustand’s persistence middleware really helped me out here by saving everything in local storage.
- **Form Integration**: Working with **Material UI** and **React Hook Form** together was fun but had some quirks. I had to make sure the form validation and custom components played nicely together.

## Improvements I’d Love to Make

I’m always looking for ways to improve, and here’s what’s next on my list:

- **Optimized Price Updates**: Instead of fetching the crypto prices every time someone creates or edits an order, I’d like to have a centralized price store to minimize API requests and update prices periodically.
- **Better Mobile Experience**: The app is responsive, but I think there’s room for improvement in how the design adapts, especially for smaller devices.
- **More Testing**: I added some basic unit tests, but I’d like to improve coverage, especially for edge cases and error handling.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Right now, if the CoinGecko API fails, the user doesn’t get much feedback. I’d like to improve the user experience by adding better error handling and fallbacks.
