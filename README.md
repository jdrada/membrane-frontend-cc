# OTC Order Management Interface

Welcome to the OTC Order Management Interface, my solution to the OTC order management challenge. This app lets users create, view, edit, and delete cryptocurrency buy/sell orders, all while getting real-time USD conversions. Below, Iâ€™ll walk you through the features, how to run the project, and some of the challenges I faced along the way.

## Features

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the core features I implemented, based on the challenge:

### Order Creation Form

- **Buy/Sell Toggle**: A simple radio button lets users switch between placing a buy or sell order.
- **Cryptocurrency Selection**: A dropdown menu with a predefined list of cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) for users to choose from.
- **Quantity Input**: Users can specify the quantity of the selected cryptocurrency.
- **USD Conversion**: Real-time price conversion using the CoinGecko API. As users enter the quantity, the USD equivalent updates instantly.
- **Expiration Date**: The expiration date field shows a helper text with the time in UTC, ensuring all dates are handled correctly.

### Order Listing

- After an order is created, it appears in a list with details like direction (buy/sell), selected cryptocurrency, quantity, USD equivalent, and expiration date.
- Users can also view full details, edit, or delete any order.

### Order Management

- **Edit Mode**: Users can update any existing order, with the form fields pre-populated for ease of use.
- **Delete**: Orders can be deleted with a simple click.

### API Integration

- Integrated with the **CoinGecko API** to fetch real-time cryptocurrency prices and handle conversions dynamically.

### State Management

- Used **Zustand** for lightweight, flexible state management and **React Query** for API handling and data fetching.
- Orders are persisted in **localStorage** so they remain available even after a page refresh.

### Input Validation & Testing

- The quantity field ensures only positive numbers are accepted.
- Basic form validation ensures all fields are filled out correctly before allowing the user to submit.
- A few **unit tests** demonstrate functionality and form validation.

## How to Run the Project

Letâ€™s get you started! Hereâ€™s how to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/membrane-frontend-cc.git
   cd membrane-frontend-cc
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) ðŸŽ‰.

4. **Run tests** (if you want to check out the tests):

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

   Or to watch tests while you code:

   ```bash
   npm run test:watch
   ```

## Environment Variables

Before the app works properly, youâ€™ll need to set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variable:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price
```

This ensures the app can fetch real-time cryptocurrency prices from the CoinGecko API.

## Challenges I Faced

Every project has its tricky bits! Hereâ€™s what I found challenging:

- **Real-time Price Updates**: Making sure the USD conversion updated smoothly while the user was still typing took some work. Using React Query for data fetching and Zustand for state management really helped.
- **Form Management**: Integrating **Material UI** and **React Hook Form** for the form UI was fun but required some finessing, especially with custom validation and dynamic updates.

- **Date Handling in UTC**: I had to make sure that even though users input local dates, everything was converted to UTC behind the scenes to meet the challenge requirements.

## Future Improvements

This was a fun project, and thereâ€™s always room for improvement! Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™d work on next:

- **Optimizing API Requests**: Iâ€™d like to centralize the price fetching mechanism, reduce redundant API calls, and update prices on a periodic schedule.
- **More Tests**: While Iâ€™ve added some basic unit tests, I want to improve coverage, especially around edge cases like handling API errors or user inputs.
- **Enhanced Mobile UX**: The app is responsive, but Iâ€™d love to polish the experience more for smaller devices.

## Folder Structure & Design Patterns

Iâ€™ve structured the project using a clear, scalable approach. The main components are organized based on functionality, and the state management with Zustand is modular and easy to extend. Following clean code principles, Iâ€™ve kept the separation of concerns in mind.

- **Components**: UI components and form handling logic are modularized.
- **Services**: The CoinGecko API logic is placed in a service file to keep things tidy.
- **Stores**: Zustand manages global state, and React Query handles external data (like price fetching).
